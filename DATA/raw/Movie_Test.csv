Abraham Lincoln's Clemency,"The incidents pictured in this film are founded on fact and relate to William Scott, a young soldier from the State of Vermont. Scott is on guard after a heavy day's march, and being found asleep is placed under arrest. He is tried by court-martial and sentenced to death. Meantime we see President Lincoln in his study at the White House in deep thought, and seeing a vision of the Civil War and the sorrow caused by it. The vision disappears and he reads a letter from Mrs. Scott pleading for the pardon of her son. Deeply affected he lays the letter down and sees another vision, that of the gray-haired mother and a nameless grave. We next see being marched off to the spot where he is to be shot. All is in readiness for the fatal word of command to be given, when through a cloud of dust a coach dashes up attended by outriders. The President steps out and pardons the prisoner, who falls on his knees and blesses him. The next scene is that of a battle with the Union soldiers retreating. The color-bearer falls, but William Scott rushes up, grabs the flag and rallies the Union troops, but amid the dreadful carnage he himself is shot. That night the doctors and ambulances are searching among the dead for the wounded who are still alive. They reach Scott. He is dying. A vision of the President appears before him, giving him a wreath of fame. Scott staggers to his feet, and as the vision fades away, drops dead. As a fitting climax, we see a tableau of President Lincoln taking from a Union and a Confederate color-bearer their respective flags, rolling them together and when they are unrolled displaying the Stars and Stripes.—Moving Picture World synopsis"

The Secret of the Well,"In France the tale opens. A mystifying murder has occurred. The nephews of the murdered man swear to run down the guilty party. Their search takes them to India, where they run into unlooked-for and dangerous obstacles. We have the brilliant Oriental fete given in their honor. At this fete an attempt is made on the young Frenchmen's lives through poison. Jean Farades is at last able to write to his nephews from India that he is returning with a fortune. The reception of the letter provokes jealousy between the two brothers, who, hitherto had been on affectionate terms. They erect a wall separating their respective gardens, between which there is a well common to both. One morning a tradesman goes to the well for a bucket of water for his horse. His efforts to draw it up proving futile, he sends a lad down to ascertain the cause. Trembling with fear and excitement, the lad reappears and informs the bystanders that the body of a man lies at the bottom. They notify the Commissary of Police. The two brothers identify the body of their uncle. The magistrate orders their immediate arrest. Fortunately for the brothers, Jacques Velimay and his friend, Paul Mersains, set to work to solve the mystery. They discover a scrap of paper in the well. It is torn, but they manage to decipher that it is a receipt for securities deposited with a banker named Smithworth, in Calcutta. A telegram is sent to Smithworth for details of Farades' securities. Climpson, Smithworth's agent in Paris, breaks into Jacques Vellmay's house, and steals the incriminating document from his desk. Soon after, Vellmay receives a telegram from Smithworth, saying that Farades is unknown to him. This coupled with the discovery that his desk has been tampered with, confirms his suspicions, and he at once goes off to Calcutta with his friend, Paul. Here, under assumed names, they enter into pseudo negotiations with Smithworth. The banker is, however, on his guard. That night Smithworth gives a brilliant fete in honor of the two Europeans, and manages to pour the drug into the cups of his guests. Jacques and Paul abstain from drinking. Smithworth falls asleep. The two friends escape and return to the banker's office where they regain possession of the document stolen from Vellmay's desk by Climpson. Smithworth is roused and gives chase in a motorboat. As soon as he is close enough, he fires upon them; their frail boat is upset and they vanish under the water. The friends, however, manage to swim ashore and return to Paris. The two scoundrels meet in Paris, and go to the trail of the brothers after disguising themselves. Suddenly the court is interrupted by two men. ""Stop. Stop. Here are the names of the murderers!"" they cry. The two scoundrels try to escape. They are dragged before the magistrate, and Climpson, seeing the game is up, confesses it was he who had strangled Farades, and with the help of Smithworth, had thrown him to the bottom of the well. The two brothers are reconciled after their terrible experience.—Moving Picture World synopsis"
The Sparrow,"Mafflu, the old clown, out walking is greatly surprised to see a baby girl, fast asleep, holding in her hand a chunk of bread, at which a large number of sparrows are pecking. Mafflu decides to take the child away with him and care for it. He does this, but upon arriving at the circus where he is employed, the owner and the rest of the company have but a cold greeting for the little newcomer. However, Mafflu clings to the child. The Sparrow, as she is called, grows up and becomes the drudge of the circus. One evening, though worn out by fatigue and hunger, she must still prepare for the evening show. Scarcely has she mounted her horse and made a few rounds of the arena, when she falls and lies unconscious in the center of the arena. Romarin is in a rage and strikes the girl. Mafflu is disgusted and sends an official to the mayor. M. de Ganges, who that night happened to be a spectator. M. de Ganges takes the Sparrow with him to his home and she bids farewell to the only two beings she has ever loved, her adopted father and a poodle. Next morning, on awaking, she can hardly believe that all the beautiful things about her are a reality. The dream is indeed but a fleeting one. The Sparrow is received with jeers and mockery when she puts in an appearance in the servants' dining-room for her meals. A few days later a horse runs away in the park and the Sparrow cleverly manages to master it. This makes the groom, Charley, madly jealous. Charley abuses the Sparrow and a free fight ensues. M. de Ganges intervenes, and, disgusted with the groom's impudence, discharges him. The Sparrow is now received into the intimacy of the Mayor's family. She has fine clothes and jewels. A friend of the family, the banker Schlemmer, spends a few days at the mansion and is strangely attracted to the Sparrow. The attraction is not reciprocated, for, by degrees, the Sparrow falls in love with M. de Ganges. Alas, one day, she surprises him in a close embrace with his cousin. She is jealous. Schlemmer still persecutes the Sparrow to the extent of doing her violence. She decides to leave the house. In a few lines she thanks her benefactors for their goodness and announces her departure without, however, revealing its real cause. The Sparrow signs a very profitable contract with a new circus and she forgets, to a certain extent, her former disappointments. However, her troubles are not over yet. Charley, engaged as groom at the circus, finds occasion to exercise his hatred. After a first performance, the Sparrow goes to her dressing-room to change her costume for a second appearance. When, on hearing a noise, she turns around, and is horrified to see Schlemmer, introduced there by the groom, and who endeavors to abuse the girl, who defends herself energetically. Fortunately for her, Mafflu and the stage manager, wondering why she does not appear, enter her room and put an end to the trouble. Although not quite recovered from the shock, the Sparrow, nevertheless, takes her place on the central platform, where she is to perform her aerial act. M. de Ganges and his young wife are also spectators. In seeing the one she loves and who is forever lost to her, the Sparrow is painfully affected and, without ceasing to look at him, she makes a sudden leap, misses the rope along which she was to glide to earth, and crashes to the ground. Mafflu, in tears, picks up the girl, whose back is broken, and carries her away. M. de Ganges, deeply moved, comes to her and the Sparrow has, at least, the consolation of beholding before her death the dear face of the loved one.—Moving Picture World synopsis"

A Venetian Night,"Venice, what emotions it awakens in the Young Stranger as he reads about it in his book. He decides to pay this beautiful city a visit. Upon his arrival, he walks from the railroad station to the landing place on the Grand Canal. There the crowd watches him with amusement as he blunderingly makes his way. Pitrello, a hotel tout, sees in the awkward Young Stranger a likely mark. He seizes his baggage, hurries him into a gondola and conducts him through a network of canals and bridges to the hotel. In the meantime, the Bridegroom, a rich wine merchant, is escorting his young Bride to the church where they are to be married. She is unutterably sad because her heart is elsewhere. Suddenly her face lights up; nearby stands the Officer, her true love. And now the gondola of the Young Stranger nears the scene. He lands and, as he is looking about curiously, the bridal party passes and he is smitten with the beauty of the pale Bride. After the services the bridal party proceeds toward the hotel, the same one for which the Young Stranger is headed. The Young Bride cannot forget her Officer. She throws a rose to him as he stands below looking at her pleadingly. The Young Stranger, mistaking her intention, thinks the rose is meant for him. A merry wedding feast is held in the courtyard of the hotel. The Officer waits for stolen sweets and the Bride smiles at him. Her smiles the Young Stranger intercepts and takes for himself. Love's message meant for another. While the dancing continues, the Bride pleads sudden indisposition and retires to her room. The Young Stranger in an adjoining room goes to sleep with the rose of his romance at his lips. The events of the day had made a deep impression upon him, and now his brain, active in sleep, conjures up before him a wonderful dream. At first all the people he met during the events of the day pass before him in a shadowy dance. Then he sees the room of the Bride. Within it stands the Officer, pleading with her. There is a knock at the door. What shall she do? She hides him behind the curtains and the Bridegroom enters. He has been drinking very freely. But now Pitrello drops from the upper transom. Unseen by the Bridegroom, he stealthily creeps behind the curtain and engages in mortal combat with the Officer. He kills the Officer, but so swiftly and silently is this accomplished that only the Bride, her face turned toward the combatants, is aware of the tragedy. She renews her pleading with her husband that he leave her room for the night. He yields to her request. The criminal Pitrello had, in the meantime, escaped. Terror-stricken, the Bride hides the dead body in her own bed. From the Young Stranger's room the Bride hears a song of love. An idea occurs to her. She will ask him to dispose of the body for her. He sees her, dresses rapidly and follows. The Young Stranger pleads his love. Suddenly the Bride horrifies him by showing him the corpse. She entreats him to help her. At first he is reluctant, but finally he consents. The Young Stranger drags the body to the balcony. Pitrello, however, dogs his every step and frustrates his intentions. Here is an opportunity, the deep well. Into its depth the dead body will go. But no, Pitrello squats upon the lid and the Young Stranger drags the corpse to a boat. He boards the boat with his dreadful charge, so does Pitrello. For the far-off shores of the Island of the Dead he steers and there he throws the body into the silent waters of the lagoon. At last he is free to rejoin the Bride. But Pitrello leaps into the waters and drags the body back to shore. Then he conjures up three more bodies. He sets them up, one after another, like so many nine-pins and the Young Stranger recoils from the ghastly sight. Outlined in shadow, the little craft re-crosses the waters of the lagoon. When the Young Stranger lands, however, he is again confronted with peril. The Officer, come to life, rushes at him, sword in hand. They fence and the Young Stranger is victorious. Another Officer, however, leaps toward him. Another scuffle. Thus he struggles with the four and kills them. But he has reckoned without Pitrello. His Evil Genius breathes hack the spark of life into them. They arise and pursue the fleeing Young Stranger. A vast mob brandishing weapons follows after. But the Young Stranger manages to reach the Bride's room. There he relates his fearful misadventures. She listens to him sadly and at last rewards him with a kiss. The drinking and dancing had continued in the lobby of the hotel all through the night. The Bridegroom, drunk, is conducted by the servants, under the leadership of Pitrello, into the Young Stranger's room. They deposit the Bridegroom in the Young Stranger's bed. But the Young Stranger soon begins to feel the weight of his little bed partner. At first he imagines that the hand he holds belongs to the Bride, but he is soon disillusioned. In disgust, he wriggles his way out of bed, dresses and gets ready for departure. The Bride has come out smiling and inquires after her husband. There is much commotion among the servants working eagerly for the much coveted tips. Pitrello, ever quick, has stirred into action even the lazy fellow, who, tired from the revelry of last night, is sleeping on the stairs. All is bustle and hurry-scurry as the bridal party leaves in a gondola. Poor Young Stranger. His dream of love cannot stand the daylight of reality. Sadly he notes how the Bride has made room in the gondola for the Officer. The fat Bridegroom is too stupid to know her real feelings, but the Young Stranger understands. He presses to his lips the cherished rose of sweet romance, and as the bridal party glides under the bridge on which he is standing, he showers its petals upon her.—Moving Picture World synopsis"

The District Attorney,"Matthews Brainerd, a wealthy contractor and head of a grafting political gang, has formulated a plan for a great scoop from the City Treasury in the form of the forging of city warrants. This is hanging fire, however, because his chief minions, McGrath and Williams, have been unable to find someone who would be willing to stand trial for the crime for a sum of money. The stool pigeon is eventually found in the person of Frank Pierson, a clerk in the Warrant Office, who is betrothed to Helen Knight, but their marriage has been many times postponed on account of his inability to improve her condition in life. Tempted by McGrath and Williams, Pierson agrees to stand trial for the crime for the sum of $50,000, with the understanding that after serving a few months in the penitentiary the ring will exert its influence to have him pardoned. A meeting occurs between Pierson and the gang, and instead of a cash payment he demands five notes for $10,000 each, and these he entrusts for safe keeping with Mrs. Varrick, his lodging housekeeper, until such time as he shall be discharged from prison. But the gang decide that in order to secure their own future safely their victim must be kept out of the way, and three years elapse without anything having been done toward the release of Pierson. He writes to Helen to interest herself in his case, and at the same time makes his story known to General Ruggles, editor of a great reform newspaper, who has been for some time conducting a bitter fight against the ring, and both seek to have the case reopened through the district attorney. This is no less a person than Brainerd's son-in-law, John Stratton, elected to the office through the influence of Brainerd and his gang. After many attempts to secure an interview with Stratton, Helen interests him in her case, with the assistance of his wife, and Stratton decides to bring Pierson before the Grand Jury to prove his allegation that he was the victim of a plot. To keep Helen from being tampered with by the agents of the gang, she is made a visitor in the Brainerd home, and while there receives a letter from Frank Pierson, telling her to proceed at once to Mrs. Varrick's, secure the papers which will prove his innocence, and deliver them to the district attorney. The ring is plunged into a lever of dread lest its members be exposed through the efforts of Ruggles and the district attorney, and the most desperate plan of action is determined upon. McGrath is entrusted with the duty of expunging the pages of the trial from the court records, while Williams is sent to Sing Sing to ""get to"" Pierson. But the district attorney has given orders that no one is to be allowed to see the prisoner without an order from him, and in lieu of an interview with Pierson, Williams secures from the letter clerk of the prison a copy of Pierson's letter to Helen giving the address of the house where the incriminating papers are concealed. Helen arrives at the house before him, however, secures the papers and takes them to the Brainerd home. Here Brainerd succeeds in convincing her that the district attorney's purpose is to see that Pierson is not to be released. She entrusts the papers with him and he burns them in the fireplace. Full of the conviction that Stratton is Pierson's enemy and Dot his friend, Helen refuses to give her evidence to the Grand Jury, and on Pierson alone devolves the onus of giving the only testimony that can clear him. He tells the story of his agreement with the gang, and when Brainerd's name is mentioned as being the head of it, he collapses in the court and is taken home in a dangerous condition. McGrath is arrested for having tampered with the court records; Williams departs for Canada, and Brainerd finally confesses that Pierson has been the innocent victim of a cruel plot. Now the crushed and broken ""boss"" pleads for mercy, but even his own daughter cannot bring herself to see him cleared at the expense of her husband's honor, and since Brainerd's death seems only a matter of a very short time, his arrest and trial are left for future consideration.—Moving Picture World synopsis"

Shadows from the Past,"Mary Fitz Allen has three suitors, Arthur Barton, a young soldier, Robert Jardon, a barrister, and Lord Lester, already past middle age, but devoted to her. Her heart, however, is wholly Barton's, and while, being very gracious with Lord Lester, has an ill-concealed dislike for Jardon. Her mother is purse-proud and favors the suit of Lord Lester. Jardon sees Mary and Barton talking together in the garden, and from her words, gathers something of what has passed between them. Later, in the village inn, he makes a remark against Mary's character that Barton overhears and the young soldier knocks him down. Barton returns to the barracks, but is told that in falling Jardon had been struck on the head and is now dead. Advised by his companions to leave the country at once, Barton sends a note to Mary, assuring her that ""he will never desert her,"" but will send for her as soon as he is safe in another land. Receiving the letter, Mary falls in a swoon. Mrs. Fitz Allen tells Lord Lester that she is taking Mary to the continent for a visit, and that the girl will probably be more willing to do her bidding and marry Lester on their return. Then she takes Mary to the home of an old family servant of the Fitz Allen's, and there Mary's child is born. The mother makes the old woman swear to keep from Mary the fact that her child is alive, and, later, when they return to their home, Mary has the double grief of believing her child dead, and her lover unfaithful to her, for Mrs. Fitz Allen takes possession of the three letters that Barton has written to her during her absence. It is now that Mary consents to marry Lord Lester. Meantime Barton has shipped aboard a vessel bound for America, but in a quarrel with one of the seamen, has been thrown overboard and drowned. Fifteen years later, Mary, now Lady Lester, is living happily with her husband, whom she has learned to truly love. Jardon is living in bachelor quarters, and Babette, a young French woman, who is infatuated with him, is an inmate of his house. All these years, Mrs. Fitz Allen has been paying for the care given the child by the old servant. Jardon, calling on Lord Lester, picks up and carries away with him a letter addressed to Mary's mother, written by the child's guardian, requesting more money with which to purchase clothes for her. Reading this at his home, Jardon immediately realizes the truth, and determines to compel Mary to listen to his protestations of love by threatening to expose her past life. Meantime, Jardon has turned the French woman out of his house, and she, suspecting that Lady Lester is her rival, obtains a position as maid in her house, in order to spy upon her. On the night that Jardon makes it thoroughly plain to Lady Lester that he knows her secret, he is visited, at midnight, by Lady Lester herself. He pleads with her, and finally threatens her, but she leaves him after declaring that she will tell her husband everything of her own accord. As she leaves the house, Babette enters, and goes to Jardon's bedroom. He orders her out, and in the quarrel which follows, she draws a revolver and shoots him dead. When the crime is discovered, Lady Lester's handkerchief is found in Jardon's hand, and she is suspected of being the murderess. Overhearing the detective talking with Lord Lester, she writes a note of farewell to her husband and goes away to the farm where her child is living. Almost at the moment that her note is handed to Lester, a telephone message to the effect that Babette has confessed to being the murderer, is received. Lord Lester, learning of his wife's whereabouts, sends his housekeeper after her with a message that he wants, not only his wife, but her child, to come to him.—Moving Picture World synopsis"

Majoor Frans,"At Castle ""De Werve"", debt-ridden Colonel von Zwenken's daughter and her husband John Mordaunt await the birth of a child. Mordaunt's aunt has promised that if it is a son named after her late husband, she will allow the boy an annual allowance of 20,000 guilders. When a daughter is born, Mordaunt, anxious to keep the money, telegraphs Aunt Roselaar that he has a son called Francis, or Frans for short. When the mother dies, father and grandfather bring up Frans as a boy. The nursemaid tries to prevent this by teaching her a girl's manners, but is thwarted by Rolf, Von Zwenken's adjutant, who teaches the girl to ride and to fence and nicknames her Major Frans. When Frans is ten-years-old, her father dies and Aunt Roselaar, who has never seen her ""nephew"", visits the castle. The deception infuriates her. She will send no more money but will pay for her education if Frans is sent to a boarding-school. Thereafter, Von Zwenken and Rolf go to the East Indies with the army. For Frans, accustomed to do as she pleases, life at school is a misery. During an excursion, the head-mistress leaves her handbag in a tram. Frans, mounting the horse of a cavalry soldier, dashes after the tram and retrieves the bag. For this exploit, she is expelled because of her unladylike behavior. With her nursemaid she returns to ""De Werve"", where she is joined by her grandfather and Rolf, back from the Indies, and resumes her life as wild ""Major Frans"". She witnesses how Von Zwenken gives money to his son Rudolf, a student, telling him that because of his own debts he can give the young man no more. Back at the University, Rudolf spends every penny. Forced to give up his studies, he joins the cavalry, deserts and lands in prison. Shocked by his son's behavior, Von Zwenken is advised to go to a health resort. This he can only do after Frans pawns her jewels. Helped by Frans, Rudolf escapes and, in a foreign country, works as a croupier in the hotel where his father is staying. He sees his father lose all his money and money borrowed from a friend. Forced to return to ""De Werve"", Von Zwenken, hearing that Frans was responsible for the death of their coachman, promises to care for the widow. When the promissory note he has signed arrives, he accuses Rudolf of having forged his signature. Rolf now re-joins the household and contributes to the upkeep of ""De Werve"". Leo van Zonshoven, a cousin of Frans, comes on a visit. He is welcomed by Von Zwenken on hearing that Leo has been made Aunt Roselaar's sole heir. She had told Leo that it would please her if he were to marry Frans, whom she has disinherited for fear that the grandfather would waste the money. When Francis and Leo fall in love, Von Zwenken, seeing the end of his financial difficulties, gladly consents to their marriage. The young people are happy until Frans reads a letter from her grandfather's money-lender suggesting that Leo is only marrying her to get the inheritance. She breaks off the engagement without giving Leo an opportunity to defend himself. Back at home, Leo becomes seriously ill and is confined to bed for many weeks. When Von Zwenken dies, the castle is distrained upon his creditors. Frans, forced to leave, writes to her uncle Rudolf, now a jockey in a circus, asking for a job as an equestrienne. Rolf sees her in the circus and tells Leo. Together they persuade her to give up this unfitting profession. Leo tells Frans that he has bought ""De Werve"" and urges her to live there as long as she wants. One day Frans finds in her grandfather's room an unopened letter written by Aunt Roselaar to Leo and sent by Leo to Von Zwenken in justification of his visit. Frans realizes how wrongfully she has accused Leo. Before long, Frans and Leo are united in marriage.—Dutch Film Archive Database"

She believed she had a gift for writing and came to New York to seek a position on a newspaper. She was assigned to Chinatown to get an opium den story. She missed her escort and bravely and foolishly went to Chinatown alone. She yielded to the invitation of a Chinaman to enter his shop and inspect some beads, and he was at the point of attacking her when a storm of revolver shots broke, and a tong war was on. At the crack of the first pistol the Chinese shopkeeper desisted from his evil designs and shoved Dorothy into a secret room, the door of which he closed and locked on the outside. The girl was mad with fear. To her through the deadening walls came the sounds of the shooting. Then the shots ceased as suddenly as they had begun, and she heard faintly the gongs of police ambulances and patrols. Had she been liberated she would have seen white-jacketed emergency surgeons and orderlies picking up dead and wounded Chinamen and putting them into the wagons, while blue-coated officers with busy clubs rounded up other Chinamen, dragging them from all sorts of odd holes and corners and packing them into patrol wagons. ""Worst tong fight in years,"" a sergeant observed pleasantly to a newspaper man. ""Seven dead already, and some of the wounded sure to die. These Chinks shoot mighty straight for heathen. In the dark, too. What always puzzled me was how one tong could spot the other tong when they get mixed up in one of these nasty little wars. All Chinks look pretty much alike to me. You can never find out what started one of those shooting festivals. They won't tell a white man a thing. We can take our fill of guessing, though.

A Daughter of Uncle Sam,"Episode One: Jessie Emerson, a young American society belle with a serious turn of mind, has adopted wireless telegraphy as a hobby. While experimenting she is visited by Von Prague, a social adventurer, who is really the chief of America's enemies within, although posing as a loyal citizen of his adopted country. A code message picked up by the young woman operator attracts his attention and he suggests that she copy it and turn it over to Lieutenant Blake, an inventor who has been working upon a marvelous invention which promises to overthrow the traditional methods of warfare. Securing the confidence of Jessie, Von Prague copies the message and then directs one of his agents to steal the secret code used by the government. That night a group of plotters meet at the Von Prague home and, with the aid of a map, enter into a detailed discussion of spy and intrigue activities in the United States, such as I.W.W. agitations in the West, the destruction of munitions factories in the East and the inauguration of pro-German propaganda in the Middle West. The code message stolen by Von Prague proves to be from the War Department ordering Captain Taylor to begin the work of hunting down spies and plotters. In the meantime one of the plotters, disguised as a workman, plants a bomb which destroys a factory with loss of life, and escapes. Captain Taylor meets Jessie, who offers her aid in tracking down the enemies of her country. Captain Taylor obtains for her a position in a private wireless station where she will be able to intercept suspicious messages. She reports for duty at a time when the air is filled with mysterious code messages flashing across the seas and over the continent. Episode Two: Lieutenant Blake, having completed the model of his theoscope, invites his cousin, Jessie, to witness the initial test. This remarkable invention enables its user to pry into secrets hidden by walls and distances. Word of its completion is speedily carried to Von Prague by Blake's assistant, a spy. Looking through the theoscope, Jessie observes a battleship sailing for action in foreign waters, and in the air a government aeroplane performing unusual stunts. She also finds that she can peer through the walls of an apartment house, and is so enthused over the invention that she urges her cousin to give it to the government at once. The following day Blake meets General Norton, who becomes interested in the theoscope and arranges to send Blake to Washington with it that night. Von Prague hears of these plans and determines to learn the secret of the invention which would make secret military operations, night raids and aeroplane bombardments impossible. Two false bluejackets meet Blake at the pier. He finds too late he is not being taken to his ship. The sailors overpower him and take him to the den of the plotters, where he is offered the choice of giving up the secret of his invention or death. He chooses the latter, and then the spies offer him money. This, too, is refused, and in the fight that follows Blake knocks down Von Prague and is about to escape when he is set upon from behind and knocked out. He is dropped through a trap into the river. Jessie, with the aid of the theoscope, locates Blake in the den of spies, and immediately rushes to the river to rescue him.

Mothers of Today,"Mothers of Today includes the sole motion picture performance of radio star Esther Field, who was well known on the airwaves of the 1930s as the 'Yiddishe Mama.' The film exemplifies the Yiddish film genre of shund, a brand of popular entertainment which appealed to working-class Jewish-American immigrant audiences with broadly-drawn, sentimental stories that reflected the daily life and culture of a distinctively American Yiddish community. While the shund films were invariably low-budget (and low-brow) affairs, these humble productions formed an important part of life in the United States for their audience. For actresses such as Field or Celia Adler (star of Where is My Child?, also directed by Lynn in 1939), shund offered one of the few opportunities to play strong leading roles. In retrospect, Mothers of Today is an important cultural artifact expressing the anxieties of Jewish immigrant families faced with the younger generation's increasing assimilation into mainstream American society. Shund often dealt with the plight of the Jewish mother, recognizing the important role women played in Jewish family life during the difficult period of immigration. Such is the case with Mothers of Today, in which Field plays a mother coping with her children's troubles resulting from their straying from Jewish tradition. In one subplot, a cantor's son led astray by a woman of ""questionable morality"" becomes involved with gangsters and ends up stealing the deed to his mother's store. On March 14, 1939, Film Daily reviewed Mothers of Today as follows: ""Heavy tragedy, which seems to be an essential basis of all Yiddish dramas, is done to a turn in this new film and it should please the dyed in the wool Yiddish fans. Produced on a small budget with a hurried shooting schedule, the film has considerable merit. Cast members, with the exception of the talented Esther Field, were recruited from the stage for their initial appearance on the screen, and they give Miss Field adequate support. Henry Lynn directs the film feelingly. The story deals with the tragedies which beset Miss Field as her children get in trouble.""—National Center for Jewish Film"

Curious to find out more, Jalandhar journeys to his father, Sagar (Ocean), who tells that he had attempted to make peace between the Devas and the Danavs by offering them sweet nectar of life, but Bhagwan Vishnu had taken the shape of a beautiful woman, Mohini, and made sure that only the Devas got the nectar. Jalandhar is angered at this, and declares war against Bhagwan Vishnu and the Devas. Vrunda begs him not to go, as Vishnu is all powerful.

3715. Jihad,"The most dangerous madmen are those created by religion, and people whose aim is to disrupt the society always know how to make good use of them on occasion. With various outfits of terrorism spreading its tentacles across the world this three centuries old quote of Denis Diderot seems to be apt and as contemporary as it can be. With vulnerable youths falling for the stories of getting an opportunity to work for Allah and empowered with thoughts that your hands will kill the innocent but Allah will forgive all has given these youths the notion that all is fair on the course of Jihad. In the history of mankind, fanaticism has caused more harm than any vice. Despite a space of several years the wounds inflicted by the Indian army in Kashmir were still fresh in Altaaf's mind when he joined the terrorist outfit with the pious thoughts of wiping away the enemies of Islam. Little did he know that he had in turn, gullibly fallen into the trap of people with vested interest and crooked ideas. During one of his assignments Altaaf meets Bhavna, widow of a doctor they had once killed on the suspicion of being an informer of the army. Holed out at Bhavna's house, Altaaf undergoes a metamorphosis as he witnesses Bhavna's plight and helplessness. History however, is replete with the stories of Jihadis or the soldiers of the Holy War, who at some point during their fight for religion realize that they have taken an erroneous decision. Realize that bullets can win wars but not hearts and in the bargain comprehend that they are treading on a path of no return. Jihad is the journey of the militant Altaaf and his realization of the futility of his holy war as he stumbles upon a few truths. That unfortunately Jihad is generally misunderstood to be true Islam. Whereas Islam stands for humanity. Islam prevails amidst brotherhood of people. And Altaaf also learns the supreme truth. That the true meaning of Jihad is not the holy war outside but the war within. Jihad is nothing but overpowering your inner devil. Firearms can give death, not life. Impart life if you can..!!. He realizes."

4303. Itanagar 0KM,"Produced by Alison Welly, ""Itanagar 0KM"" depicts the story of young a man and his struggle. Though Heartbroken and shattered; the film gives clue that he has a good life ahead.

The major chunk has been given to unemployment problem. The protagonist does not sit idle waiting for some politician's help or any miracles to happen. In spite, he does all odd works including selling bamboo, giving tuition, engaging in poultry farm, even work as a cobbler but succeeds in none. Chima's (protagonist) struggles are symbol of every youth's struggle giving a message not to surrender during adversity.

It is a story of a youth named Chime charmingly played by Tai Tugung who strives to make two ends meet and the journey of his topsy-turvy life. The audience gets a front-row seat as the film starts with heart touching dialogue between young friends Jumar and Chime through a letter, talking about the brighter and darker side of life that is offered to them separately. The film goes on from a small start of the difficult life of a child (chime) who works hard to find a job -to the ripple effects of unemployment in grown up Chime's life. Scoring some great emotional points, the central character Chime touches the heart of the audience with his natural performance. The characterisations have strong connecting points; opposite Tai Tugung is Nabam Ana who plays the role of Margam and is seen flaunting her kindness to support a struggler. Itanagar 0 Km, in a way, appears to be a reminisce of road trip films that have recently captured the imagination of Bollywood film-makers. The Bollywood industry that ranges from subject matters like corruption, an honest cop beating out the bad man, a common man's fight against the system have now ventured into this road trips genre. Itanagar 0 Km is close to that, having revealing moments like those of road trip movies where the protagonist's emotions are expressed in the short ride he takes, be it with his friend or wandering alone in the roadsides to riding back home after ""The Revelation"". Critics may judge minus for some stereotypes in the film. Apart from emotional outbursts, there are some jaw-cracking moments in the film that give the audience no time to adjust to the ¬giggle wavelength. The film is supported with melodious Hindi songs offering the conventional touch of Bollywood films to the audience. The makers of the film are confident that the people of the state will accept the film for its storyline more so for the Arunachalee brand of Hindi that is used in the film. This movie is based on a true story reflecting the contemporary society with special focus on the youth of our society, said the producer of the film Allison Welly on the premier night. Expressing much satisfaction with the release of Itanagar 0 Km, the proprietor of Cinepolis 3D Nending Lahzeey said that Cinepolis is lucky enough to have a role in promoting regional films, thereby encouraging local film-makers. The film is a testimony of a hard working team led by director Tai Gungte, trying to notch up a level in the Arunachal film industry.
